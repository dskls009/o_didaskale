# o_didaskale
This is a discord bot called Ô DIDÁSKALE that seeks to help ancient greek students memorize declensions and other paradigms.
I looked up another in progress bot that does the same (https://github.com/Novemberstuart/Aletheia) but decided to start my own bot since its last commit was in april.

## Requirements.txt

Go to the directory where requirements.txt is then type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
on your shell

## Run the bot

Go to the directory where o_didaskale.py is then type:
```
python o_didaskale.py
```
on your shell

## .env

Do not forget to create a bot on discord and getting its token. Create a file names .env on the same directory that the o_didaskale.py is and then put it inside the .env file:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=(TOKEN)
```
without ().
